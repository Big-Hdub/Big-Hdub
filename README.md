About me:

  I am 43 years old and switching careers.  I have done construction and apartment management for 20+ years and as my body has started to fail me I am turning to a hobby for a new career path.  I am excited to apply all that I have learned at App Academy to get started on this path.  My loving wife and 3 kids have been very supportive of me during this transition and all the time I have needed to devote to studying and learning new languages and skills.  I am hard-working and willling to go the extra mile to be able to support and provide for my wonderful family.
